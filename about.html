  <h1>About Demat Shield</h1>
  <p>
    Demat Shield is an independent investor guidance platform focused on
    demat account operational issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many investors face delays or unclear responses from their Depository
    Participant. Our role is to help investors understand whether an issue
    falls under demat processes and what the next practical step should be.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not act on behalf of investors and we do not guarantee outcomes.
    Our service is limited to guidance and process understanding.
